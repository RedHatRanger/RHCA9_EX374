## Day 14 Study Focus: Review & Comprehensive Practice

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* Review and solidify understanding of all previously covered EX374 objectives, including:
    * Git Usage
    * Inventory Management (Static YAML, Dynamic Concepts, Variables via `group_vars`/`host_vars`)
    * Task Execution (Privilege Escalation, Control Flow, Tags, Optimization)
    * Data Transformation (Filters, Lookups, Advanced Loops)
    * Task Delegation & Rolling Updates
    * Content Collection Creation & Usage
    * Execution Environment Creation & Usage
    * Automation Controller Integration (Credentials, Projects, Inventories, Templates, EEs)
* Apply learned skills by attempting comprehensive review labs that integrate multiple objectives.
* Identify and revisit any remaining weak areas based on lab performance.

### Conceptual Overview: Bringing It All Together

Today is about consolidating your knowledge and putting it into practice. No new core concepts are introduced; instead, the focus shifts to applying the skills you've learned over the past 13 days in more complex, integrated scenarios, similar to the comprehensive review labs found at the end of typical course material.

The goal is to simulate tasks requiring you to combine different techniques. This involves analyzing requirements, selecting the right Ansible features, implementing the solution (playbooks, roles, variables, etc.), testing with `ansible-navigator` or Controller, and troubleshooting.

### Examples Based on Comprehensive Review Lab Concepts

Here are more specific examples (CLI) and conceptual UI workflows related to the types of tasks found in the comprehensive review labs described previously.

**1. Lab Concept: Managing Inventory Variables & Navigator Config**

* **Focus:** Variable organization, `ansible-navigator` config, Git.
* **CLI Examples:**
    * **Creating `group_vars` structure:**
        ```bash
        # In your project root
        mkdir -p group_vars/web_servers group_vars/db_servers
        # Create/edit files like group_vars/web_servers/apache.yml
        # Create/edit files like group_vars/db_servers/database.yml
        ```
    * **Configuring `ansible-navigator.yml`:**
        ```yaml
        # ansible-navigator.yml
        ---
        ansible-navigator:
          # Use a specific EE by default
          execution-environment:
            image: [hub.example.com/ee-supported-rhel8:latest](https://hub.example.com/ee-supported-rhel8:latest)
            pull:
              policy: missing # Pull only if not present locally
          # Disable artifact creation to allow password prompts (if needed)
          playbook-artifact:
            enable: false
          # Optional: Set default logging level
          logging:
            level: debug
        ```
    * **Configuring `ansible.cfg` for inventory path:**
        ```ini
        # ansible.cfg
        [defaults]
        inventory = ./inventory_directory/ # Tell Ansible where to find inventory sources
        remote_user = devops
        # ... other settings ...
        ```
    * **Git commands:** (As covered on Day 2)
        ```bash
        git add group_vars/ ansible-navigator.yml ansible.cfg inventory/
        git commit -m "Refactor variables and configure navigator"
        git push origin <your-branch>
        ```
* **UI Aspects:** Primarily CLI focused, but involves understanding how `ansible-navigator` reads its config and how Ansible finds `group_vars`.

**2. Lab Concept: Optimizing a Playbook for Large-scale Use**

* **Focus:** Efficiency, safety, task control.
* **CLI/Playbook Examples:**
    * **Enabling Profiling in `ansible.cfg`:**
        ```ini
        # ansible.cfg
        [defaults]
        # ... other settings ...
        callbacks_enabled = ansible.posix.timer, ansible.posix.profile_tasks
        ```
    * **Refactoring `yum` loop:**
        ```yaml
        # BAD: Loop is slow
        # - name: Install packages (slow way)
        #   ansible.builtin.yum:
        #     name: "{{ item }}"
        #     state: present
        #   loop: [httpd, php, mariadb-server]

        # GOOD: Single transaction is fast
        - name: Install packages (fast way)
          ansible.builtin.yum:
            name:
              - httpd
              - php
              - mariadb-server
            state: present
          tags: # Add a tag for selective testing
            - package_install
        ```
    * **Implementing Rolling Update in Playbook:**
        ```yaml
        # my_update_playbook.yml
        ---
        - name: Rolling Update for App Servers
          hosts: app_servers
          become: true
          serial: # Define batches
            - 1      # Test on 1 first
            - 30%    # Then do 30% per batch
            - 100%   # Then do the rest
          max_fail_percentage: 0 # Stop if any host fails in a batch

          pre_tasks:
            - name: Remove server from Load Balancer
              community.general.haproxy: # Example module
                # ... params ...
                state: disabled
                host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
              delegate_to: load_balancer_host # Run on LB

          roles:
            - role: deploy_new_app_version

          post_tasks:
            - name: Run Health Check
              ansible.builtin.uri: # ... params ...
              delegate_to: load_balancer_host # Test from LB

            - name: Add server back to Load Balancer
              community.general.haproxy: # Example module
                # ... params ...
                state: enabled
                host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
              delegate_to: load_balancer_host # Run on LB
        ```
    * **Running tagged task:**
        ```bash
        ansible-navigator run my_update_playbook.yml --tags package_install
        ```
* **UI Aspects:** Primarily CLI/Playbook focused. Analysis involves reading the terminal output from callbacks.

**3. Lab Concept: Creating & Using Custom Collections & EEs**

* **Focus:** Packaging automation, building EEs, Hub/Controller integration.
* **CLI Examples:** (As covered on Day 13)
    * **Collection:** `ansible-galaxy collection init ...`, edit `galaxy.yml`, `ansible-galaxy collection build`
    * **EE Build:** Edit `execution-environment.yml`, `requirements.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `bindep.txt`, `ansible.cfg` (for build-time auth), `ansible-builder build --tag ...` (or `create` + `podman build`)
    * **Publishing:** `podman login ...`, `podman push ...` (for EEs), `ansible-galaxy collection publish ...` (for Collections)
* **Conceptual UI Workflows:**
    * **Publishing Collection to Hub:**
        1.  Log in to Private Hub UI.
        2.  Navigate to Namespaces, ensure your namespace exists and you have permissions.
        3.  Click "Upload collection".
        4.  Select the built `.tar.gz` file.
        5.  Upload.
        6.  Navigate to "Approval" queue (if applicable).
        7.  Review import log/lint results.
        8.  Approve the collection version.
    * **Configuring Custom EE in Controller:**
        1.  (If needed) Add 'Container Registry' Credential in Controller UI (Resources > Credentials > Add) with details for pulling from your registry.
        2.  Add 'Execution Environment' in Controller UI (Administration > Execution Environments > Add).
        3.  Give it a Name (e.g., "My Custom EE v1").
        4.  Enter the full Image path (e.g., `myregistry.example.com/myorg/my-custom-ee:v1`).
        5.  Select the Pull policy.
        6.  Select the appropriate Registry credential.
        7.  Save.
    * **Using Custom EE in Controller Job Template:**
        1.  Navigate to Resources > Templates. Edit or Add a Job Template.
        2.  In the 'Execution Environment' dropdown, select the custom EE you added ("My Custom EE v1").
        3.  Configure other settings (Project, Playbook, Inventory, Credentials).
        4.  Save.
        5.  Launch the Job Template. Controller will now pull (if needed) and use your custom EE to run the job.

**Today's Goal:** Attempt the comprehensive labs from the course material. Use these examples and the conceptual steps as a reference for the types of commands and workflows involved. Focus on integrating the skills learned across all previous days.

**Reminder:** These examples and conceptual flows are guides. The actual comprehensive review labs require careful reading of their specific requirements and hands-on implementation within the provided lab environment to truly test your skills.
