## Day 7 Study Focus: Dynamic Inventories & Practice

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* **Manage advanced inventories:**
    * Describe the purpose and benefits of dynamic inventories compared to static files.
    * Understand the two main types: inventory plug-ins and inventory scripts.
    * **Create a dynamic inventory** (conceptually understanding how plug-ins/scripts work with external sources like cloud providers or CMDBs).
    * Use an existing inventory script or plug-in configuration file as an inventory source.
* Apply inventory concepts (Static YAML, `group_vars`/`host_vars`, Dynamic) through hands-on practice.

### Conceptual Overview: Dynamic Inventories - Why and What?

Static inventory files (like the YAML ones from Day 5) are great when your list of computers doesn't change often. But what about environments like the cloud (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) or virtualization platforms (VMware, OpenStack, RHV) where servers are created and destroyed frequently? Manually updating a static file becomes impossible.

This is where **Dynamic Inventories** come in. Instead of a fixed list, a dynamic inventory asks an *external source of truth* (like your cloud provider's API or a Configuration Management Database - CMDB) for the current list of active servers and their properties right when Ansible needs it.

**Benefits:**

* **Accuracy:** Always works with the current state of your infrastructure.
* **Automation:** No manual updating of host lists needed when servers are added or removed.
* **Rich Data:** Can often pull in useful metadata (like cloud tags, regions, instance sizes) and automatically group hosts based on that data.

**Two Main Types:**

1.  **Inventory Plug-ins (Preferred Method):**
    * These are pieces of code (usually Python, often provided within Ansible Content Collections) specifically designed to talk to a particular source (e.g., `amazon.aws.aws_ec2`, `redhat.satellite.foreman`, `vmware.vmware_vm_inventory`).
    * You typically configure them using a YAML file (e.g., `my_aws_inventory.aws_ec2.yml`) that tells the plug-in how to connect (API keys, URLs, credentials) and how to filter or group the results (e.g., "only give me servers tagged 'production' in the 'us-east-1' region").
    * Ansible comes with many built-in plug-ins, and more are available in collections.

2.  **Inventory Scripts (Older Method):**
    * An executable script (written in any language - Python, Bash, etc.) that Ansible runs.
    * The script must be able to output the inventory data in a specific JSON format.
    * When Ansible runs the script with `--list`, it must output the entire inventory (groups, hosts, variables).
    * When run with `--host <hostname>`, it must output the variables for just that specific host.
    * This is more flexible if you have a very custom source, but plug-ins are generally easier to use and maintain if one exists for your source.

### Conceptual Overview: Using Dynamic Inventories

Using a dynamic inventory is very similar to using a static one from the command line:

* **Using an Inventory Plug-in:** You point `ansible-navigator` to the plug-in's YAML configuration file. Ansible recognizes the file structure (often ending in `<plugin_name>.yml` or `.yaml`) and uses the corresponding plug-in.
    ```bash
    # Example using an AWS EC2 inventory plug-in config file
    ansible-navigator run my_playbook.yml -i my_aws_inventory.aws_ec2.yml
    ```

* **Using an Inventory Script:** You point `ansible-navigator` directly to the executable script file. Ansible sees that it's executable and runs it to get the inventory data.
    ```bash
    # Example using a custom Python inventory script
    # Ensure the script has execute permissions (chmod +x)
    ansible-navigator run my_playbook.yml -i ./scripts/my_custom_inventory.py
    ```

* **Using an Inventory Directory:** If you provide a directory path to `-i`, Ansible processes *all* valid inventory sources inside that directory (static files, plug-in configs, executable scripts) and merges them into one combined inventory for the playbook run.
    ```bash
    # Example using a directory containing multiple sources
    ansible-navigator run my_playbook.yml -i ./inventory_sources/
    ```
    * **Important:** If using a directory with mixed static and dynamic sources, be careful if your static files reference groups that are defined *only* in the dynamic source. The order files are processed isn't guaranteed. It's safer for static files to include empty placeholder definitions (like `[my_dynamic_group]`) for any groups they reference, even if the members come from a dynamic source.

**Today's Goal:** Understand *why* dynamic inventories are used and the difference between plug-ins and scripts. Learn how to tell `ansible-navigator` to use one. Apply all the inventory concepts learned so far in the hands-on lab.

### Examples

**1. Example Inventory Plug-in Configuration Structure (Conceptual)**

This shows the *kind* of information you put in a plug-in config file (syntax varies slightly per plug-in). **This is NOT runnable code**, just an illustration.

```yaml
# my_cloud_inventory.aws_ec2.yml (Hypothetical example)
# --- Tells Ansible which plugin code to use ---
plugin: amazon.aws.aws_ec2

# --- Tells the plugin how to connect & authenticate ---
# (These would likely come from environment variables or a vault in reality)
aws_access_key: YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
aws_secret_key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY
regions:
  - us-east-1
  - us-west-2

# --- Tells the plugin how to filter hosts ---
filters:
  instance-state-name: running # Only include running instances
  "tag:Environment": production # Only instances tagged with Environment=production

# --- Tells the plugin how to group hosts ---
keyed_groups:
  # Create groups based on the value of the 'Region' tag
  - key: tags.Region
    prefix: aws_region
  # Create groups based on the instance type
  - key: instance_type
    prefix: aws_type
```

**2. Using Different Inventory Sources (Illustrative Commands)**

```bash
# Using a plugin configuration file
ansible-navigator run site.yml -i my_cloud_inventory.aws_ec2.yml

# Using an executable inventory script
ansible-navigator run site.yml -i ./scripts/get_lab_hosts.py

# Using a directory containing multiple source files (static, dynamic, plugin configs)
ansible-navigator run site.yml -i ./production_inventory/
```

**Reminder:** Dynamic inventories are powerful for real-world, changing environments. Understanding how they work conceptually is important. The hands-on lab for inventories will likely combine static files, `group_vars`/`host_vars`, and potentially a simple dynamic script example to give you practice with all the concepts from Days 5, 6, and 7. Completing the lab exercises is crucial.
