## Day 5 Study Focus: Inventory Basics & YAML Format

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* Understand the purpose and basic structure of an Ansible inventory.
* **Create and manage inventory files** using YAML syntax.
* Define hosts and groups, including nested groups (parent/child relationships).
* Understand how to define basic variables directly within a YAML inventory (though external files are often preferred).

### Conceptual Overview: What is an Ansible Inventory?

The inventory is Ansible's address book. It tells Ansible:

1.  **Which computers (hosts)** it should manage.
2.  **How those hosts are organized (groups)**.

Without an inventory, Ansible doesn't know *where* to apply your playbooks. While inventories can be dynamic (fetched from external sources, covered later), today we focus on static inventory files written in YAML.

**Why YAML for Inventories?**

* **Human-Readable:** YAML uses indentation and simple key-value pairs, making it easier to read and write than older formats like INI.
* **Structured:** It naturally represents hierarchical data like groups containing hosts or other groups.
* **Powerful:** Allows defining variables directly within the inventory structure (though often better done in separate files).

### Conceptual Overview: YAML Inventory Structure

YAML inventories use indentation (typically 2 spaces) to show structure.

* **Groups:** Top-level keys in the YAML file usually represent group names. A group name is followed by a colon (`:`).
    ```yaml
    web_servers:
      # Content for this group goes here, indented
    db_servers:
      # Content for this group goes here, indented
    ```
* **Hosts:** Under a group, use the `hosts:` keyword (indented) to list the computers belonging to that group. Each hostname is a key, followed by a colon (`:`). The colon signifies the end of the host definition itself; you can optionally define host-specific variables indented underneath it.
    ```yaml
    web_servers:
      hosts:
        web1.example.com: # Host definition
        web2.example.com:
          # Variables specific to web2 could go here, indented further
          # ansible_port: 2222
    ```
* **Child Groups (Nesting):** Under a group, use the `children:` keyword (indented) to list other groups whose members should *also* be considered part of the parent group. This creates hierarchies.
    ```yaml
    data_center_london:
      children: # Groups nested under data_center_london
        london_web_servers: # Define this group elsewhere...
        london_db_servers:  # Define this group elsewhere...
      # You can also have hosts directly in data_center_london if needed
      # hosts:
      #   network_switch_lon_1:

    london_web_servers:
      hosts:
        lon-web-1:
        lon-web-2:

    london_db_servers:
      hosts:
        lon-db-1:
    ```
* **The `all` Group:** Ansible implicitly has a top-level group called `all` that contains every host defined anywhere in the inventory. You *can* explicitly define `all:` in your YAML file, often to define `children` or `vars` that apply globally.
* **Inline Variables (`vars:`):** Under a group or a specific host, you can use the `vars:` keyword (indented) to define variables that apply to that group or host.
    ```yaml
    db_servers:
      hosts:
        db1.example.com:
        localhost:
          # Special variable telling Ansible how to connect to localhost
          ansible_connection: local
      vars: # Variables applying to ALL hosts in db_servers
        database_type: postgresql
        backup_enabled: true
    ```
    **Note:** While convenient for simple things like `ansible_connection`, defining lots of variables directly in the inventory can make it cluttered. Using separate `group_vars/` and `host_vars/` directories (covered next) is usually cleaner for managing most variables.

**Today's Goal:** Learn the basic building blocks of a YAML inventory file: defining groups, adding hosts to groups, nesting groups using `children:`, and optionally adding simple variables using `vars:`.

### Example: YAML Inventory File

This example combines several concepts:

```yaml
# inventory.yml - Example Static Inventory

all: # Explicitly defining the 'all' group
  children: # All other top-level groups are children of 'all'
    web_servers: # Group for web servers
      hosts:
        web1.example.com: # Host 1
        web2.example.com: # Host 2
          ansible_port: 2222 # Host-specific variable for web2
      vars: # Group variables for all web_servers
        http_port: 80
        service_name: httpd
    db_servers: # Group for database servers
      hosts:
        db1.example.com:
        db2.example.com:
      vars: # Group variables for all db_servers
        db_port: 5432
        service_name: postgresql
    load_balancers: # Group for load balancers
      hosts:
        lb1.example.com:
          ansible_user: haproxy_admin # Connect as a specific user for this host
    
    # Geographical grouping
    emea:
      children: # EMEA contains web and db servers
        web_servers: # web_servers group is part of emea
        db_servers:  # db_servers group is part of emea
      vars: # Variables for all hosts in emea (web & db)
        ntp_server: ntp.emea.example.com
    
    # Special group for the control node itself
    local:
      hosts:
        localhost: # The machine running Ansible
          ansible_connection: local # Tell Ansible not to use SSH
          ansible_python_interpreter: "{{ ansible_playbook_python }}" # Use same python as ansible

# Note: A host like web1.example.com is in groups 'web_servers', 'emea', and 'all'.
# It inherits variables from all of them, with more specific groups overriding less specific ones.
```

**Reminder:** Practice creating these structures. Correct indentation is critical in YAML! Using a text editor with YAML syntax highlighting can help avoid errors. Remember that while you *can* put variables here, Day 6 will focus on the preferred method using `group_vars` and `host_vars` directories.
