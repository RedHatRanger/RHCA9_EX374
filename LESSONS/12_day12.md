## Day 12 Study Focus: Task Delegation & Rolling Updates

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* **Delegate tasks:**
    * **Run a task for a managed host on a different host** using `delegate_to`.
    * **Control whether facts gathered by a task are delegated** to the managed host or the controlling host using `delegate_facts`.
* **Manage task execution:**
    * Implement rolling updates using the `serial` keyword to control batch processing.
    * Control failure tolerance during rolling updates using `max_fail_percentage`.
    * Execute tasks once per batch using `run_once`.

### Conceptual Overview: Delegating Tasks

Sometimes, when managing a host (`host_A`), you need to run a specific command or interact with a service that's actually on a *different* machine (`host_B`), but the action is related to `host_A`. This is called delegation.

**Why Delegate?**

* **Interacting with Central Services:** Talking to a load balancer API to remove `host_A` from rotation before updating it. The task runs *on the load balancer* but uses information about `host_A`.
* **Running Tasks Locally:** Executing a command or API call from the Ansible control node (or more accurately, the Execution Environment container) because the necessary tools or network access exist there, not on the managed host. Use `delegate_to: localhost`.
* **Testing Connectivity:** Running a check *from* a monitoring server *to* the managed host to verify firewall rules or service availability.

**How to Delegate:**

* **`delegate_to: <hostname_or_group_name>`:** Add this directive to a specific task. Ansible will execute that task on the host specified in `delegate_to` instead of the host the play is currently processing (`inventory_hostname`).
    ```yaml
    - name: Remove server from load balancer pool
      community.general.haproxy:
        state: disabled
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}" # Still uses the name of the host being processed
        # ... other haproxy params ...
      delegate_to: load_balancer_server # Run this module ON the load balancer
    ```
* **`delegate_to: localhost`:** A common case. This runs the task *inside the Execution Environment container* where `ansible-navigator` is running. Useful for API calls or local scripts within the EE.

**Fact Handling During Delegation:**

* **Default Behavior:** When a task is delegated, it still uses the variables and facts (`ansible_facts`) of the *original host* (`inventory_hostname`) the play is currently targeting. This is usually what you want (e.g., telling the load balancer to disable the *correct* backend server name).
* **`delegate_facts: true`:** If you add this directive to a delegated task, any facts *gathered by that specific task* (e.g., using `ansible.builtin.setup` or if the module itself returns facts) will be associated with the host the task was *delegated to*, not the original host. This is less common but useful if you need to collect information *about* the delegated host during the play.

### Conceptual Overview: Rolling Updates

When updating multiple servers that provide a service (like web servers behind a load balancer), you usually don't want to update them all at once, as that could cause an outage. A **rolling update** involves updating servers in small batches.

**Controlling Batches (`serial`):**

* **Keyword:** Add `serial:` at the *play* level.
* **Function:** Instead of running each task across *all* hosts in the play before moving to the next task, `serial` makes Ansible run the *entire play* (all tasks and notified handlers) on a small batch of hosts before moving to the next batch.
* **Values:**
    * **Integer:** `serial: 2` - Process 2 hosts at a time.
    * **Percentage:** `serial: '25%'` - Process 25% of the total hosts in the play per batch (minimum 1).
    * **List:** `serial: [1, 5, '50%']` - Process batches sequentially with the specified sizes (first batch=1 host, second batch=5 hosts, third batch=50% of total hosts). If hosts remain after the list is exhausted, the *last* size in the list is repeated. `100%` as the last item means "all remaining hosts".

**Controlling Failure (`max_fail_percentage`):**

* **Keyword:** Add `max_fail_percentage:` at the *play* level (often used with `serial`).
* **Function:** Defines the maximum percentage of hosts *within the current batch* that can fail before Ansible aborts the *entire play* for all remaining batches.
* **Value:** `max_fail_percentage: 0` means "zero tolerance" - if *any* host in the current batch fails any task, the entire play stops immediately. `max_fail_percentage: 50` means the play continues as long as less than half the hosts in the *current batch* fail.
* **Default:** If not set, the play only stops if *all* hosts in a batch fail.

**Running Tasks Once Per Batch (`run_once`):**

* **Keyword:** Add `run_once: true` to a specific *task*.
* **Function:** When used in a play with `serial`, this task will only execute one time *for each batch*, usually on the first host Ansible processes in that batch (or on the delegated host if `delegate_to` is also used).
* **Use Case:** Notifying a monitoring system once when a batch starts/finishes, checking external dependencies once per batch.
* **Run Once for Entire Play:** If you need a task to run only once for the *entire play* (across all batches), use `run_once: true` combined with a condition like `when: inventory_hostname == ansible_play_hosts[0]`.

**Today's Goal:** Learn how to use `delegate_to` to run tasks on different hosts. Understand how `serial` creates batches for rolling updates and how `max_fail_percentage` controls failure tolerance. Know how to use `run_once` for batch-level actions.

### Examples

**1. Delegating to Localhost (EE)**

```yaml
- name: Call an internal API from the EE
  ansible.builtin.uri:
    url: [https://api.internal.corp/update_status](https://api.internal.corp/update_status)
    method: POST
    body: '{ "server": "{{ inventory_hostname }}", "status": "updating" }'
    body_format: json
    # ... authentication headers ...
  # Run this task inside the Execution Environment container
  delegate_to: localhost
  # Usually don't need become for localhost tasks unless interacting with EE internals
  become: false
```

**2. Delegating Facts**

```yaml
- name: Get facts about the monitoring server itself
  ansible.builtin.setup: # Gather facts
  delegate_to: monitoring.example.com # Run setup ON the monitoring server
  # Store the gathered facts under hostvars['monitoring.example.com']
  delegate_facts: true

- name: Use a fact from the monitoring server
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    msg: "Monitoring server OS is {{ hostvars['monitoring.example.com']['ansible_facts']['distribution'] }}"
```

**3. Rolling Update Play Structure**

```yaml
- name: Safely Update Web Servers
  hosts: web_servers
  become: true
  # --- Rolling Update Strategy ---
  serial: # Process in stages
    - 1     # First, try just one server
    - 25%   # Then, do 25% of the total per batch
    - 100%  # Finally, do all the rest
  max_fail_percentage: 0 # Stop immediately if any host fails

  pre_tasks:
    - name: Notify start of batch update (runs once per batch)
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Starting update batch including {{ ansible_play_batch | join(', ') }}"
      run_once: true # Only run this debug message once per batch

    - name: Disable server in Load Balancer
      community.general.haproxy: # ... params ...
      delegate_to: lb_host

  roles:
    - role: update_app_code

  post_tasks:
    - name: Health Check
      ansible.builtin.uri: # ... params ...
      delegate_to: lb_host

    - name: Enable server in Load Balancer
      community.general.haproxy: # ... params ...
      delegate_to: lb_host

    - name: Notify end of batch update (runs once per batch)
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "Finished update batch including {{ ansible_play_batch | join(', ') }}"
      run_once: true
```

**Reminder:** Delegation and rolling updates are key techniques for managing real-world infrastructure safely and efficiently. Pay close attention to where tasks run (`delegate_to`) and how batches are processed (`serial`). Practice these concepts in the labs.
