## Day 8 Study Focus: Privilege Escalation & Task Execution Flow

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* **Manage task execution:**
    * **Control privilege execution** using the `become` directive at play, block, or task levels.
* Understand the standard order of execution within an Ansible play, including `pre_tasks`, `roles`, `tasks`, `post_tasks`, and `handlers`.
* Use handlers (`notify:`, `handlers:`) effectively to trigger actions only when needed.
* Use `listen:` to allow multiple handlers to respond to the same notification.

### Conceptual Overview: Controlling Privilege Escalation (`become`)

Many system administration tasks require root (or another privileged user) access. Ansible uses the `become` system to handle this, typically using `sudo` by default.

* **Purpose:** To run specific tasks or entire plays as a different user (usually `root`).
* **Key Directive:** `become: true` (or `yes`) enables privilege escalation for the scope where it's applied. `become: false` (or `no`) disables it.
* **Where to Apply:**
    * **Play Level:** Set `become: true` at the top level of a play to make *all* tasks within that play run with escalated privileges by default.
    * **Block Level:** You can group several tasks within a `block:` and apply `become: true` (or `false`) just to that block, overriding the play-level setting for those specific tasks.
    * **Task Level:** Apply `become: true` (or `false`) directly to a single task to override the play or block setting just for that one task.
* **Best Practice:** Use the *least privilege necessary*. If a play mostly needs root, set `become: true` at the play level and then explicitly set `become: false` on individual tasks that *don't* need root (like checking a web page with the `uri` module). Conversely, if most tasks don't need root, set `become: false` at the play level and `become: true` only on the specific tasks or blocks that require it.
* **Related Directives:**
    * `become_user:` Specifies which user to become (defaults to `root`).
    * `become_method:` Specifies the method (`sudo`, `su`, `pbrun`, etc.). Defaults to `sudo`.
    * `become_flags:` Adds command-line flags to the become method (rarely needed).

### Conceptual Overview: Task Execution Order & Handlers

Ansible runs tasks within a play in a specific, predictable order, regardless of how you arrange the sections in your YAML file:

1.  **`pre_tasks`:** Any tasks listed here run first. Useful for setup actions that must happen before roles or main tasks (e.g., disabling monitoring).
2.  **Handlers Notified by `pre_tasks`:** If any task in `pre_tasks` notified a handler, those handlers run *now*.
3.  **`roles`:** Any roles listed in the `roles:` section are executed next. Tasks within the roles run.
4.  **`tasks`:** The main list of tasks for the play runs after roles.
5.  **Handlers Notified by `roles` or `tasks`:** If any task in the `roles` or `tasks` sections notified a handler, those handlers run *now*.
6.  **`post_tasks`:** Any tasks listed here run last. Useful for cleanup actions or final checks that must happen after everything else (e.g., re-enabling monitoring).
7.  **Handlers Notified by `post_tasks`:** If any task in `post_tasks` notified a handler, those handlers run *now*.

**Handlers: Running Tasks Conditionally**

* **Purpose:** Handlers are special tasks defined in a `handlers:` block at the end of a play. They only run if they are *notified* by another task during the play.
* **Notification:** A task uses the `notify: Handler Name` directive. If that task makes a change (or its state is 'changed'), it signals the handler with that name to run *at the end of its section* (pre_tasks, tasks, post_tasks).
* **Use Case:** Restarting a service only if its configuration file was actually changed by a `template` or `copy` task. This avoids unnecessary restarts.
* **Order:** Handlers run in the order they are defined in the `handlers:` block, *not* the order they were notified.
* **`listen:`:** Instead of notifying a specific handler name, a task can `notify: Some Topic Name`. Handlers can then use `listen: Some Topic Name` to subscribe to that topic. This allows one notification to trigger multiple handlers, which is great for decoupling actions (e.g., restarting a service *and* sending a notification when a config changes).

**Today's Goal:** Understand how `become` controls privileges and where to apply it. Learn the standard execution flow (`pre_tasks`, `roles`, `tasks`, `post_tasks`) and how handlers (`notify`, `handlers`, `listen`) fit into that flow to perform actions conditionally.

### Example (Privilege Escalation, Flow, Handlers, Listen)

```yaml
# service_config.yml - Demonstrating execution flow and handlers
---
- name: Configure and Manage My Service
  hosts: app_servers
  # Default to NOT using become for the play
  become: false

  pre_tasks: # Runs First
    - name: Ensure dependencies are installed
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: ['coreutils', 'tar'] # Example packages
        state: present
      become: true # Package installation needs root

    - name: Notify monitoring system about maintenance start
      community.general.slack: # Example notification module
        msg: "Starting maintenance on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
        # ... other slack params ...
      delegate_to: localhost # Run notification task on control node/EE
      # No become needed here
      notify: Log Maintenance Window # Notify a topic

  # Roles would run here if specified

  tasks: # Runs after pre_tasks and roles
    - name: Deploy service configuration file
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: my_service.conf.j2
        dest: /etc/my_service.conf
      become: true # Writing to /etc needs root
      notify: # Notify multiple things if this changes
        - Restart My Service # Specific handler name
        - Config Change Actions # A topic name

    - name: Ensure service is running
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: my_service
        state: started
        enabled: true
      become: true # Managing service needs root

  post_tasks: # Runs Last (after tasks and task handlers)
    - name: Notify monitoring system about maintenance end
      community.general.slack:
        msg: "Finished maintenance on {{ inventory_hostname }}"
        # ... other slack params ...
      delegate_to: localhost
      notify: Log Maintenance Window # Notify the same topic again

  handlers: # Defined at the end, run only when notified
    - name: Restart My Service # Matches specific notify
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: my_service
        state: restarted
      become: true # Restarting needs root

    - name: Clear Service Cache # Listens to a topic
      ansible.builtin.command: /usr/local/bin/clear_cache.sh my_service
      become: true
      listen: Config Change Actions # Triggered by the template task

    - name: Log Configuration Update # Also listens to the same topic
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /var/log/config_updates.log
        line: "{{ inventory_hostname }} config updated at {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601 }}"
        create: yes
      listen: Config Change Actions # Triggered by the template task

    - name: Log Maintenance Window # Listens to a topic notified by pre/post tasks
      ansible.builtin.lineinfile:
        path: /var/log/maintenance.log
        line: "Maintenance window event on {{ inventory_hostname }} at {{ ansible_date_time.iso8601 }}"
        create: yes
      listen: Log Maintenance Window # Handler name matches listen topic here
```

**Reminder:** Controlling *who* runs *what* (`become`) and *when* things run (`pre_tasks`, `post_tasks`, `handlers`) are fundamental to creating robust and safe automation. Practice these concepts thoroughly.
