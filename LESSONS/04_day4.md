## Day 4 Study Focus: Finding & Installing Collections

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* **Manage content collections:**
    * Find desired collections using sources like Automation Hub or Ansible Galaxy.
    * **Install a content collection** individually using `ansible-galaxy`.
    * Install multiple content collections using a `requirements.yml` file.
    * Understand how to configure `ansible-galaxy` to use different collection sources (like a private Automation Hub).

### Conceptual Overview: Where to Find Collections

You know Collections are like toolkits, but where do you get them?

1.  **Automation Hub:**
    * **Red Hat Automation Hub (console.redhat.com):** This is the official place for **certified** and **supported** collections from Red Hat and its partners. You need a Red Hat subscription to access and download from here. This is the preferred source for enterprise environments.
    * **Private Automation Hub:** Your company can run its own Hub server. This lets you manage a curated set of collections (maybe only approved ones) and share internally developed collections.
2.  **Ansible Galaxy (galaxy.ansible.com):** This is the public, community hub. Anyone can upload collections here. Quality and support vary widely, so use with discretion, but it has a vast amount of content.

You typically browse the web interfaces for these hubs to find collections you need.

### Conceptual Overview: Installing Collections

Once you find a collection you need (and it's not already built into your Execution Environment), you need to install it so Ansible can use its modules and roles.

**Why Install Locally?**

Remember Execution Environments (EEs)? They are self-contained. If a collection isn't *inside* the EE image you're using, the EE can't use it by default. However, `ansible-navigator` (and Automation Controller) can make content from your *project directory* available inside the EE when it runs. The standard practice is to install needed collections into a specific subdirectory within your project.

**Methods for Installation:**

1.  **`ansible-galaxy collection install <namespace.collection>`:**
    * This command downloads and installs a single collection.
    * By default, it tries to install into your user's home directory (`~/.ansible/collections`). **This is usually NOT what you want when using EEs**, as the EE won't see it there.
    * **Crucial Option:** Use `-p <path>` or `--collections-path <path>` to specify *where* to install it. For projects meant to run in EEs, you almost always install into a subfolder within your project, typically named `collections`:
        ```bash
        # Installs the collection into the 'collections' subdir of the current project
        ansible-galaxy collection install community.mysql -p ./collections/
        ```
    * Ansible automatically looks for a `collections/ansible_collections/` path relative to your playbook, so installing into `./collections/` makes the content available to the EE during playbook execution.

2.  **`collections/requirements.yml` File:**
    * This is the best way to manage multiple collection dependencies for a project.
    * Create a file named `requirements.yml` inside a `collections/` directory in your project root.
    * List the collections your project needs in YAML format. You can specify versions and sources.
    * **Example `collections/requirements.yml`:**
        ```yaml
        ---
        collections:
          - name: community.general # Get latest from default source (usually Galaxy)
          - name: ansible.posix
            version: '>=1.3.0' # Specify minimum version
          - name: my_company.internal_tools
            source: [https://private-hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/](https://private-hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/) # Specify source URL
            version: '2.1.0'
        ```
    * **Command:** `ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml`
        * This reads the file and installs *all* listed collections.
        * Use `-p ./collections/` if your `ansible.cfg` doesn't already point the default install path there.
        * Automation Controller automatically runs this command when syncing a project that contains this file.

### Conceptual Overview: Configuring Collection Sources (`ansible.cfg`)

How does `ansible-galaxy` know where to download collections from (Galaxy, Red Hat Hub, Private Hub)? You configure this in your `ansible.cfg` file.

* **Sections:** You define servers in `[galaxy_server.<nickname>]` sections and list which ones to use (and in what order) under `[galaxy]`.
* **Authentication:** For private hubs or Red Hat Automation Hub, you need to provide credentials, usually an **API Token**. You get this token from the Hub's web interface.
* **Example `ansible.cfg` Snippet:**
    ```ini
    [galaxy]
    # List servers to check, in order. 'galaxy' is a built-in alias for galaxy.ansible.com
    server_list = my_private_hub, rh_certified_hub, galaxy

    [galaxy_server.my_private_hub]
    # URL for your company's private hub repository
    url=[https://hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/](https://hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/)
    # API token obtained from the private hub UI
    token=abc123yourprivatehubtokenxyz

    [galaxy_server.rh_certified_hub]
    # URL for the official Red Hat Automation Hub API
    url=[https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/](https://console.redhat.com/api/automation-hub/)
    # Authentication URL for Red Hat SSO
    auth_url=[https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token](https://sso.redhat.com/auth/realms/redhat-external/protocol/openid-connect/token)
    # API token obtained from console.redhat.com
    token=def456yourredhattokenuvw
    ```

**Today's Goal:** Learn how to find collections, install them into your project directory using `ansible-galaxy` both individually and via a `requirements.yml` file, and understand how `ansible.cfg` tells the tool where to look.

### Examples

**1. Installing a Single Collection into the Project**

```bash
# Ensure you are in your project's root directory
# mkdir -p collections # Create the directory if it doesn't exist

# Install the community.general collection into ./collections/
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general -p ./collections/
```

**2. Example `collections/requirements.yml`**

```yaml
# ./collections/requirements.yml
---
collections:
  # Get latest community.crypto from default configured source (e.g., Galaxy)
  - name: community.crypto

  # Get specific version of ansible.posix from default source
  - name: ansible.posix
    version: 1.3.0

  # Get a collection from a specific Git repository branch
  # - name: my_namespace.my_collection
  #   source: git@github.com:my_namespace/my_collection.git
  #   version: dev_branch # Can be branch, tag, or commit hash
  #   type: git

  # Get a collection from a specific URL (often a private hub)
  # - name: internal_corp.utils
  #   source: [https://private.hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/](https://private.hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/)
  #   version: 1.5.2
```

**3. Installing Collections from `requirements.yml` into the Project**

```bash
# Ensure you are in your project's root directory

# Install all collections listed in collections/requirements.yml
# into the ./collections/ directory
ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml -p ./collections/
```

**4. Example `ansible.cfg` for Private Hub Access**

```ini
# ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = inventory.yml
# Ensure Ansible looks inside the project's collections dir first
collections_paths = ./collections:~/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections

[galaxy]
# Define server nicknames and the order to check them
server_list = my_hub, galaxy

[galaxy_server.my_hub]
# URL for the private hub's API endpoint (get this from the hub UI)
url=[https://hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/](https://hub.example.com/api/galaxy/content/published/)
# Your API token from the private hub UI
token=abc123yourprivatehubtokenxyz

# 'galaxy' server is built-in, points to galaxy.ansible.com
# No token needed for public Galaxy usually
```

**Reminder:** Installing collections correctly, especially into your project directory (`./collections/`), is key when working with Execution Environments. Practice using `ansible-galaxy` and managing dependencies with `requirements.yml`.
