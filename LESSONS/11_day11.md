### Conceptual Overview: Lookup Plugins - Getting External Data

While filters modify existing data, **Lookup Plugins** go out and *fetch* data from external sources right when your playbook needs it. This makes your automation dynamic and allows it to interact with the outside world.

**How Lookups Work:**

* **Syntax:** You call lookups inside Jinja2 expressions (`{{ ... }}`) using either the `lookup()` or `query()` function.
    * `{{ lookup('plugin_name', 'argument1', 'argument2', ...) }}`
    * `{{ query('plugin_name', 'argument1', 'argument2', ...) }}` (or `q()` for short)
* **`lookup` vs. `query`:**
    * `lookup()`: Often returns a single string, potentially with multiple values joined by commas (depends on the plugin).
    * `query()`: *Always* returns a **list** of results. This is generally preferred, especially when you intend to use the result in a `loop:`.
* **Where Data Comes From:** Files, environment variables, command output, APIs, password generators, DNS, CSV files, Vault secrets, etc.
* **Execution Location:** Lookups run *inside* the Execution Environment, not on the managed host. They access files and commands *within* the EE or reachable *from* the EE.

**Common Lookup Plugins:**

* **`file`:** Reads the content of one or more files (relative paths are usually searched in a `files/` subdirectory of the playbook or role).
    * `{{ lookup('file', 'my_config.txt') }}` -> Returns content as a string.
    * `{{ query('file', 'key1.pub', 'key2.pub') }}` -> Returns a list where each item is the content of one key file.
* **`template`:** Similar to `file`, but processes the file content as a Jinja2 template *before* returning it. Looks for files in `templates/`.
    * `{{ lookup('template', 'config.j2') }}`
* **`env`:** Retrieves the value of environment variables from the EE.
    * `{{ lookup('env', 'HOME') }}` -> Gets the home directory path inside the EE.
* **`pipe`:** Runs a command *inside the EE* and returns its standard output as a single string.
    * `{{ lookup('pipe', 'date +%Y-%m-%d') }}` -> Gets the current date string.
* **`lines`:** Runs a command *inside the EE* and returns its standard output as a list, with each line being an item in the list.
    * `{{ query('lines', 'ls *.txt') }}` -> Gets a list of `.txt` filenames.
* **`password`:** Generates random passwords. Can store them in files for persistence.
    * `{{ lookup('password', '/path/inside/ee/secret_file length=15') }}` -> Generates a password, stores it in `secret_file` inside the EE, and returns the password.
* **`fileglob`:** Finds files matching a pattern (like `*.conf`) *on the control node/EE*. Use `query('fileglob', ...)` to get a list suitable for loops.
* **Error Handling:** Add `errors='warn'` or `errors='ignore'` as the *last* argument to `lookup()` or `query()` if you don't want a failure (e.g., file not found) to stop the playbook. Default is `errors='strict'`.

### Conceptual Overview: Advanced Loops

The standard `loop:` keyword iterates over a simple list. But often your data isn't a simple list, or you need to generate the list dynamically.

**Looping over Complex Data (using Filters):**

* **Dictionaries:** Use the `dict2items` filter to convert a dictionary into a list of `{'key': ..., 'value': ...}` dictionaries, then loop over that list.
    ```yaml
    loop: "{{ my_dictionary | dict2items }}"
    # Inside the task, access with item.key and item.value
    ```
* **Nested Lists/Dictionaries (`subelements`):** Used when you have a list of dictionaries, and each dictionary contains *another* list you want to iterate over along with the parent item.
    ```yaml
    # users = [ {'name': 'a', 'groups': ['g1','g2']}, {'name': 'b', 'groups': ['g2','g3']} ]
    loop: "{{ users | subelements('groups') }}"
    # Inside the task, item[0] is the parent dict ({'name': 'a', ...}),
    # and item[1] is one element from the inner 'groups' list ('g1', then 'g2', etc.)
    ```
* **Flattening Lists (`flatten`):** If a lookup or variable gives you a list containing other lists, use `flatten` to make it one simple list before looping.
    ```yaml
    # list_of_lists = [ ['a','b'], ['c','d'] ]
    loop: "{{ list_of_lists | flatten }}"
    # Loops over 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'
    ```

**Looping over Dynamic Data (using `query`):**

Combine `query` with lookup plugins directly in the `loop:` definition.

* **Looping over Lines in a File:**
    ```yaml
    loop: "{{ query('lines', 'cat list_of_users.txt') }}"
    # 'item' will be each line (username) in the file
    ```
* **Looping over Files Matching a Pattern:**
    ```yaml
    loop: "{{ query('fileglob', 'templates/*.j2') }}"
    # 'item' will be each filename matching the pattern
    ```

**Retrying Tasks (`until` loop):**

Sometimes you need a task to succeed before continuing, but it might take a few tries (e.g., waiting for a service to start after a reboot).

* **Syntax:** Add `until`, `retries`, and `delay` to a task.
    ```yaml
    - name: Wait for web service to respond
      ansible.builtin.uri:
        url: http://localhost:8080/health
        status_code: 200
      register: result # Capture the task's output
      until: result.status == 200 # The condition to check (must eventually be true)
      retries: 5 # Maximum number of attempts
      delay: 10 # Seconds to wait between retries
    ```
* **How it works:** Ansible runs the task. If the `until` condition is false, it waits `delay` seconds, then tries again. It repeats up to `retries` times. If the condition becomes true, the loop stops and the task succeeds. If it fails `retries` times, the task fails.

**Today's Goal:** Learn how to use lookup plugins (`lookup`, `query`) to bring external data into variables. Practice using filters (`dict2items`, `subelements`) and lookups (`query` with `lines` or `fileglob`) within the `loop:` keyword to iterate over complex or dynamic data. Understand the `until` loop for retrying tasks.

### Examples

**1. Using `lookup('file')` and `lookup('password')`**

```yaml
- name: Create users and set authorized keys
  hosts: servers
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Create user account
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: "{{ user_name }}" # Assume user_name is defined elsewhere
        state: present
        # Generate password, store in file inside EE, use hash
        password: "{{ lookup('password', 'credentials/' + user_name + '.pass len=12') | password_hash('sha512') }}"

    - name: Set authorized key from file
      ansible.posix.authorized_key:
        user: "{{ user_name }}"
        state: present
        # Read the public key file content using file lookup
        key: "{{ lookup('file', 'files/' + user_name + '.pub') }}"
```

**2. Looping over Dictionary Items**

```yaml
- name: Configure sysctl parameters
  vars:
    sysctl_settings:
      net.ipv4.ip_forward: 1
      kernel.hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
      vm.swappiness: 10
  ansible.posix.sysctl:
    name: "{{ item.key }}" # Key from the dictionary
    value: "{{ item.value }}" # Value from the dictionary
    state: present
    reload: yes
  become: true
  loop: "{{ sysctl_settings | dict2items }}" # Convert dict to list for loop
```

**3. Looping over Nested Data (`subelements`)**

```yaml
# Assume users_and_groups is defined like:
# users_and_groups:
#   - name: alice
#     groups_to_join: [webadmin, dev]
#   - name: bob
#     groups_to_join: [dev]
- name: Add users to multiple groups
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: "{{ item.0.name }}" # User name from the parent element
    groups: "{{ item.1 }}" # Group name from the inner list element
    append: yes # Add user to group, don't replace existing groups
  become: true
  # Loop over users_and_groups, pairing each user with each group in their 'groups_to_join' list
  loop: "{{ users_and_groups | subelements('groups_to_join') }}"
```

**4. `until` Loop Example**

```yaml
- name: Restart web service
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: httpd
    state: restarted
  become: true

- name: Wait up to 1 minute for service port 80 to become available
  ansible.builtin.wait_for:
    port: 80
    delay: 5 # Check every 5 seconds
  # 'wait_for' module handles the until/retries/delay internally
  # This is often simpler than using uri + until for port checks.

# Alternative using uri and until:
# - name: Wait up to 1 minute for service health check
#   ansible.builtin.uri:
#     url: http://localhost/health
#     status_code: 200
#   register: health_check
#   until: health_check.status == 200
#   retries: 12 # 12 retries * 5 sec delay = 60 seconds
#   delay: 5
```

**Reminder:** Lookups bring the outside world into Ansible. Advanced loops let you process complex data structures efficiently. Combining filters, lookups, and loops is a powerful technique for dynamic automation. Practice is key to mastering the syntax and choosing the right tool.
