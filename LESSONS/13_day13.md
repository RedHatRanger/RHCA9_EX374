## Day 13 Study Focus: Creating Custom Collections & Execution Environments

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* **Manage content collections:**
    * **Create a content collection** structure using `ansible-galaxy`.
    * Define collection metadata and dependencies (`galaxy.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `bindep.txt`).
    * Build a distributable collection archive.
    * Understand the process to **upload content collections to automation hub** (CLI and conceptual UI).
* **Manage execution environments:**
    * Understand when and why to create custom Execution Environments (EEs).
    * **Create execution environments** using `ansible-builder` and its configuration files.
    * **Upload execution environments into automation hub** (or other container registry) using CLI tools.
    * Understand the process to configure custom EEs within Automation Controller (conceptual UI).

### Conceptual Overview: Creating Ansible Content Collections

While you'll often use collections made by others, sometimes you need to package your own roles, custom modules, or plugins for sharing within your team or organization. This is done by creating your own Content Collection.

**Steps to Create a Collection:**

1.  **Choose a Namespace:** Decide on a unique prefix for your collections (e.g., `mycorp`, `infra_team`, `student`).
2.  **Initialize the Structure:** Use `ansible-galaxy collection init <namespace>.<collection_name>`.
    * Example: `ansible-galaxy collection init mycorp.internal_utils`
    * Creates standard directories: `docs/`, `galaxy.yml`, `plugins/`, `README.md`, `roles/`.
3.  **Add Your Content:** Place roles in `roles/`, custom Python code in `plugins/modules/`, `plugins/lookup/`, etc.
4.  **Define Metadata (`galaxy.yml`):** Set `namespace`, `name`, `version`, `authors`, `description`, and list `dependencies:` (other required collections).
5.  **Define Dependencies (Optional but Recommended):** Create `requirements.txt` (Python packages) and `bindep.txt` (system packages) if your custom code needs them. Create `meta/runtime.yml` to specify `requires_ansible: '>=<version>'`.
6.  **Build the Archive:** From inside the collection directory, run `ansible-galaxy collection build`. This creates the distributable `<namespace>-<collection_name>-<version>.tar.gz` file.
7.  **Publish (Conceptual):**
    * **Via CLI:** Use `ansible-galaxy collection publish <archive.tar.gz>` (requires `ansible.cfg` configured with the target Hub's URL and API token).
    * **Via Hub UI (Conceptual Steps):**
        * Log in to your Private Automation Hub (or Ansible Galaxy).
        * Navigate to the 'Namespaces' section. Create your namespace if it doesn't exist (you might need specific permissions). Ensure appropriate groups (like 'Content Developers') are owners.
        * Within your namespace, find the 'Upload collection' (or similar) button.
        * Select the `.tar.gz` file you built.
        * Upload the file. The Hub will process and validate it (checking `galaxy.yml`, `runtime.yml`, etc.).
        * **Approval:** Depending on Hub settings, the collection might need approval before it's usable. Navigate to the 'Approval' or 'Collections' section and approve the newly uploaded version (you might need specific permissions).

### Conceptual Overview: Building Custom Execution Environments (EEs)

Standard EEs are great, but sometimes you need a custom one to include specific collections, Python libraries, or system tools not found in the defaults.

**Tool:** `ansible-builder` (install via `sudo yum install ansible-builder`).

**Steps to Build a Custom EE:**

1.  **Create Build Context Directory:** E.g., `ee-my-app-build/`.
2.  **Define Build (`execution-environment.yml`):** The main control file. Specify `version`, `build_arg_defaults` (like `EE_BASE_IMAGE`), optional `ansible_config` (for build-time auth), and `dependencies` (pointing to `requirements.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `bindep.txt`).
3.  **Create Dependency Files:** These list what *content* goes *into* the EE image:
    * `requirements.yml`: Collections to install (e.g., your custom one, `community.general`).
    * `requirements.txt`: Python packages (`pip install`).
    * `bindep.txt`: System packages (`yum install`).
4.  **Build the Image (CLI):**
    * **Simple:** `ansible-builder build --tag <registry/namespace/image_name:tag>`
    * **Advanced:** `ansible-builder create`, then manually edit `context/Containerfile`, copy needed files (like CA certs) into `context/`, then `podman build -f context/Containerfile -t <registry/namespace/image_name:tag> context/`.
5.  **Publish the Image (CLI):**
    * `podman login <registry>` (e.g., `hub.example.com`).
    * `podman push <registry/namespace/image_name:tag>`.

### Conceptual Overview: Using Custom EEs in Automation Controller (UI)

Once your custom EE image is built and pushed to a registry that Automation Controller can access (like your Private Hub's registry or another internal registry), you need to tell Controller about it.

**Conceptual UI Steps in Automation Controller:**

1.  **Add Registry Credential (if needed):**
    * Navigate to 'Credentials' under Resources/Access.
    * Click 'Add'.
    * Select 'Container Registry' as the type.
    * Enter the registry URL (e.g., `hub.example.com`), username, and password/token needed to *pull* images from that registry.
    * Save the credential. (Note: Often, a credential for the built-in Private Hub registry already exists).
2.  **Define the Execution Environment:**
    * Navigate to 'Execution Environments' under Administration.
    * Click 'Add'.
    * **Name:** Give it a friendly name (e.g., "My App EE v1.1").
    * **Image:** Enter the full image name you pushed, including the registry and tag (e.g., `hub.example.com/acme/ee-weblogic:1.1.0`).
    * **Pull:** Choose *when* Controller should pull the image (e.g., 'Always pull...', 'Only pull if not present...'). 'Always' ensures you get updates but can slow job starts.
    * **Registry credential:** Select the credential you created (or the existing one) that allows Controller to authenticate to the registry and pull the image.
    * **Organization(s):** (Optional) Assign to specific organizations if needed.
    * Save the EE definition.
3.  **Use the EE in Projects or Templates:**
    * **Project Default:** When creating or editing a Project, you can select your custom EE from the 'Execution Environment' dropdown. Jobs using this project will use this EE by default.
    * **Job Template Override:** When creating or editing a Job Template, you can select your custom EE from the 'Execution Environment' dropdown. This overrides the Project's default EE specifically for jobs launched from this template. If left blank, it uses the Project's default.

**Today's Goal:** Understand the CLI process for creating and building Collections and EEs. Conceptually understand the UI steps needed in Automation Hub (upload/approve collection) and Automation Controller (add registry credential, define EE resource, select EE in Project/Template) to make custom content usable.

### Examples (CLI Focused)

**1. Collection Build & Publish (Illustrative)**

```bash
# (Inside collection directory: e.g., acme/weblogic_deploy/)
ansible-galaxy collection build
# Creates acme-weblogic_deploy-1.1.0.tar.gz

# Publish using CLI (Requires ansible.cfg setup for the target hub)
# ansible-galaxy collection publish acme-weblogic_deploy-1.1.0.tar.gz --server my_private_hub_nickname
```

**2. EE Build & Push (Illustrative)**

```bash
# (Inside EE build context directory: e.g., ee-build/)

# Build using ansible-builder
ansible-builder build --tag [hub.example.com/acme/ee-weblogic:1.1.0](https://hub.example.com/acme/ee-weblogic:1.1.0)

# --- OR ---

# Build using podman after 'ansible-builder create' and Containerfile edits
# podman build -f context/Containerfile -t [hub.example.com/acme/ee-weblogic:1.1.0](https://hub.example.com/acme/ee-weblogic:1.1.0) context/

# Push to registry
podman login hub.example.com
podman push [hub.example.com/acme/ee-weblogic:1.1.0](https://hub.example.com/acme/ee-weblogic:1.1.0)
```

**Reminder:** Day 13 focuses heavily on the *creation* process using command-line tools. While the UI steps for publishing and configuring in Hub/Controller are necessary in practice, the hands-on focus is often on the build itself. Ensure you understand the purpose and structure of the configuration files used by `ansible-galaxy` and `ansible-builder`.
