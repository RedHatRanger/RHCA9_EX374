**Chapter 1 Summary: Developing Playbooks with Ansible Automation Platform 2 (Simple Version)**

---

### âœ… Objectives Checklist (EX374):
- [ ] Use Git to clone, edit, and push changes to a repository
- [ ] Identify and run playbooks stored in a Git repository
- [ ] Use `ansible-navigator` to run automation tasks and playbooks
- [ ] Use `become` to run tasks with admin privileges
- [ ] Understand what execution environments are and how to use them
- [ ] Use `ansible-navigator` to explore Ansible content collections
- [ ] Find help for Ansible modules and configuration settings using navigator

---

### ðŸ§  What You Learn in This Chapter:
This chapter teaches you how to use **Ansible Navigator** instead of old Ansible tools. It also shows you how to use something called an **Execution Environment**, which is like a box that holds all your Ansible tools.

Youâ€™ll also learn what **collections** are (they are bundles of Ansible stuff like tasks and roles), and how to look at your Ansible setup using commands.

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Why It Matters for the EX374 Exam:
This chapter helps with these test skills:
- **Using Git** (cloning, editing files, pushing changes)
- **Running tasks with Ansible** (doing tasks with or without admin power)

---

### âœ… Easy Terms:
- **Ansible Navigator**: A new tool that helps you run Ansible in a nice and simple way
- **Execution Environment**: A container (like a toolkit in a backpack) that has everything Ansible needs
- **Collection**: A bundle of tools that work with Ansible

---

### ðŸ’» Commands You Practice:
```bash
# Make a new folder and go there
mkdir -p ~/ansible-aap/ch1 && cd ~/ansible-aap/ch1

# Make a simple playbook file
cat <<EOF > web_setup.yml
---
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
    - name: Start and enable httpd
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true
EOF

# Run the playbook in plain text mode
ansible-navigator run web_setup.yml -m stdout --eei ee-supported-rhel8

# Run in interactive mode
ansible-navigator --eei ee-supported-rhel8

# Then in the menu, type this to run the playbook
:run web_setup.yml

# See help for a module
ansible-navigator doc yum

# Look at Ansibleâ€™s settings
ansible-navigator config

# Look at Navigatorâ€™s own settings
ansible-navigator settings

# See which collections are installed
ansible-navigator collections
```

---

### ðŸ“¦ What You Should Be Able to Do:
- Make and run a simple playbook with Navigator
- Use the built-in tools in the Execution Environment
- Look up help and settings using Navigator
- Know where your Ansible stuff (collections) lives

---

This chapter is like your **first lesson in using a new toolbox**. Youâ€™ll use these tools in every other chapter!
