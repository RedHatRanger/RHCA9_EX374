**Lesson 1 Summary: Developing Playbooks with Ansible Automation Platform 2**

---

### ðŸ“˜ Chapter Overview:
Chapter 1 introduces the foundational changes in Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2 and the tooling used to manage, develop, and execute automation content. The primary focus is on the shift from traditional Ansible CLI tools to the use of **Automation Content Navigator** and **Execution Environments (EEs)**. The chapter helps learners get familiar with:

- How playbooks are developed and run using `ansible-navigator`
- The purpose and structure of Execution Environments
- The concept of collections in Ansible
- Viewing documentation and configuration using the new tools

This chapter is about **getting hands-on quickly** with AAP 2â€™s CLI and containerized toolchain.

---

### ðŸ§  Key Concepts:
- `ansible-navigator` replaces multiple tools like `ansible-playbook`, `ansible-doc`, and `ansible-config`
- Execution Environments (EEs) are container images that package Ansible, Python dependencies, and collections
- Content Collections are modular bundles of roles, modules, and plugins
- Automation Hub and Private Automation Hub are used to host and curate collections
- `ansible-navigator` can be run in interactive (TUI) mode or stdout mode

---

### ðŸ’» Commands Used in Chapter 1:

```bash
# Create a working directory
mkdir -p ~/ansible-aap/ch1 && cd ~/ansible-aap/ch1

# Sample playbook
cat <<EOF > web_setup.yml
---
- name: Install and start Apache
  hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name: httpd
        state: present
    - name: Start and enable httpd
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true
EOF

# Run playbook using ansible-navigator in stdout mode
ansible-navigator run web_setup.yml -m stdout --eei ee-supported-rhel8

# Run ansible-navigator in TUI mode (interactive)
ansible-navigator --eei ee-supported-rhel8

# Inside TUI: Run the playbook interactively
:run web_setup.yml

# View documentation for a module (e.g., yum)
ansible-navigator doc yum

# View current Ansible config
ansible-navigator config

# View settings specific to automation content navigator
ansible-navigator settings

# List installed collections
ansible-navigator collections
```

### âœ… Outcomes by the End of Chapter:
- You should be able to create and run a playbook using `ansible-navigator`
- You understand how execution environments isolate your automation logic
- You know how to explore configuration, documentation, and collections with navigator
- Youâ€™re familiar with Red Hatâ€™s ecosystem for managing and curating Ansible content

This chapter lays the groundwork for using the platformâ€™s new tooling and helps you shift your mindset toward **containerized and modular automation workflows.**
