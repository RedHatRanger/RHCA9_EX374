**Lesson 3 Summary: Running Playbooks with Automation Controller (Simple Version)**

---

### ‚úÖ Objectives Checklist (EX374):
- [ ] Understand how automation controller (formerly Ansible Tower) works
- [ ] Create and use projects, inventories, credentials, and job templates
- [ ] Launch and monitor jobs in the web UI
- [ ] Use automation controller with execution environments (EEs)
- [ ] Understand automation mesh and how it connects different nodes

---

### üß† What You Learn in This Chapter:
This chapter teaches you how to use the **automation controller**, which is the web-based version of Ansible. It lets you run playbooks, store your inventory, and schedule jobs‚Äîall in one place.

You learn about the controller‚Äôs building blocks:
- **Projects** (where your playbooks come from)
- **Inventories** (what systems you manage)
- **Credentials** (secure login info)
- **Job Templates** (how everything connects to run a playbook)

You also see how it works with execution environments and automation mesh (a system for spreading out the work).

---

### üéØ Why It Matters for the EX374 Exam:
- You‚Äôll need to create and manage controller resources
- You must know how to run and monitor playbook jobs in the UI
- You should understand how controller connects to your EEs and systems

---

### ‚úÖ Easy Terms:
- **Automation Controller**: A web app that helps run and manage playbooks
- **Project**: A source for your playbooks (like a Git repo)
- **Inventory**: The list of systems you manage
- **Job Template**: The settings used to run a playbook
- **Automation Mesh**: A way to run jobs across multiple machines

#### 8. Verify the Result
- Run this command from any terminal:
```bash
curl http://node1.lab.example.com
```
