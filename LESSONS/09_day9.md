## Day 9 Study Focus: Selecting Tasks & Optimizing Playbooks

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* **Manage task execution:**
    * **Run selected tasks from a playbook** using tags.
* Understand and apply techniques to optimize playbook execution speed.
* Use callback plug-ins to profile playbook performance.

### Conceptual Overview: Running Selected Tasks with Tags

Sometimes, especially with large playbooks that perform many steps (like setup, configuration, deployment, testing), you only want to run a specific part. Maybe you just want to run the configuration tasks, or only the tests. Tags let you do this.

* **What are Tags?** Simple labels you attach to Ansible structures.
* **Where to Apply:** You can add a `tags:` section to:
    * **Plays:** The tag applies to all tasks within that play.
    * **Tasks:** Apply one or more tags directly to a specific task. This is very common.
    * **Blocks:** Apply tags to a `block:` of tasks.
    * **Roles (in `roles:` section):** `roles: - { role: myrole, tags: [ 'tag1', 'tag2' ] }` applies the tags to all tasks *imported* from that role.
    * **Includes/Imports:** Tagging an `include_tasks` or `import_playbook` task behaves differently depending on whether it's an include (dynamic) or import (static). Generally, tagging an *import* applies the tag to all imported tasks, while tagging an *include* requires tasks *inside* the included file to also have the tag to run when using `--tags`.
* **How to Use Tags:**
    * **`ansible-navigator run <playbook> --tags <tag1>,<tag2>`:** Runs *only* plays/tasks/roles that have *at least one* of the specified tags (`tag1` OR `tag2`).
    * **`ansible-navigator run <playbook> --skip-tags <tag1>,<tag2>`:** Runs everything *except* plays/tasks/roles that have the specified tags.
* **Special Tags:**
    * `always`: Tasks with this tag *always* run, unless explicitly skipped with `--skip-tags always`. Useful for critical setup or cleanup.
    * `never`: Tasks with this tag *never* run, unless explicitly requested with `--tags never` (or another tag also applied to the task). Good for debugging tasks you don't want running normally.
    * `tagged`: Runs only tasks that have *any* tag applied.
    * `untagged`: Runs only tasks that have *no* tags applied.
    * `all`: Runs all tasks (the default behavior).

### Conceptual Overview: Optimizing Playbook Execution Speed

As your automation grows, making playbooks run faster becomes important. Here are key techniques:

1.  **Fact Gathering:**
    * **`gather_facts: false`:** If a play doesn't use host facts (like OS version, IP addresses), turn gathering off at the play level. This saves significant time per host.
    * **Fact Caching:** Ansible caches facts during a run (memory cache by default). If you have multiple plays targeting the same hosts, gather facts in the first play and set `gather_facts: false` in subsequent plays to reuse the cached data. Automation Controller can optionally store facts between runs.
    * **`gather_subset:`:** If you only need specific types of facts (e.g., just network info), use `ansible.builtin.setup` with `gather_subset: ['!all', '!min', 'network']` to collect only what's necessary.

2.  **Parallelism (`forks`):**
    * Ansible runs tasks on multiple hosts concurrently. The `forks` setting (in `ansible.cfg` or via `ansible-navigator run -f <number>`) controls how many hosts are processed in parallel for each task.
    * The default is 5, which is often too low. Increasing it (e.g., to 20, 50, or more, depending on your control node/EE resources and network) can significantly speed up plays targeting many hosts. Don't set it too high, or you might overload your control node or network.

3.  **Efficient Module Usage:**
    * **Package Managers:** Instead of looping to install multiple packages with `ansible.builtin.yum` or `ansible.builtin.apt`, provide a list directly to the `name:` parameter. This runs only one transaction, which is much faster.
    * **File Transfers:** For copying large directories or many files, `ansible.posix.synchronize` (which uses `rsync` efficiently) is generally faster than `ansible.builtin.copy`.
    * **Avoid `lineinfile` Loops:** If you need to change multiple lines in a configuration file, using `ansible.builtin.template` to manage the whole file is usually much more efficient and reliable than multiple `lineinfile` tasks in a loop.

4.  **SSH Pipelining:**
    * Reduces the number of SSH connections needed to execute a module on a remote host.
    * Enable by setting `pipelining = True` under `[ssh_connection]` in `ansible.cfg` or via the `ANSIBLE_PIPELINING=true` environment variable for the EE.
    * **Requirement:** The remote user's `sudo` configuration must NOT have `requiretty` enabled (this is the default on modern RHEL/CentOS/Fedora).

5.  **Profiling with Callbacks:**
    * To find out *which* tasks are taking the most time, enable callback plugins in `ansible.cfg`.
    * **`timer`:** Adds total playbook run time to the summary.
    * **`profile_tasks`:** Adds a list of tasks sorted by duration to the end of the output.
    * **`profile_roles`:** Adds a list of roles sorted by duration.
    * **Example `ansible.cfg`:**
        ```ini
        [defaults]
        # ... other settings ...
        callbacks_enabled = ansible.posix.timer, ansible.posix.profile_tasks
        ```

**Today's Goal:** Learn how to use tags to control playbook execution. Understand various techniques to make playbooks run faster and how to use profiling callbacks to identify slow points. Practice applying these concepts, especially in the lab.

### Examples

**1. Tagging Tasks**

```yaml
# tasks/main.yml - Tasks with tags
---
- name: Install base system packages
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: ['vim-enhanced', 'tmux', 'git']
    state: present
  become: true
  tags: # Apply multiple tags
    - packages
    - base_setup

- name: Configure NTP client
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: chrony.conf.j2
    dest: /etc/chrony.conf
  become: true
  notify: Restart Chronyd
  tags: # Apply a single tag
    - configuration
    - ntp

- name: Ensure Chronyd service is running
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: chronyd
    state: started
    enabled: true
  become: true
  tags: ['services', 'ntp'] # List style for tags also works
```

**2. Running Tagged Tasks (Illustrative Commands)**

```bash
# Run only tasks tagged 'configuration'
ansible-navigator run site.yml --tags configuration

# Run tasks tagged 'packages' OR 'services'
ansible-navigator run site.yml --tags packages,services

# Run everything EXCEPT tasks tagged 'ntp'
ansible-navigator run site.yml --skip-tags ntp
```

**3. Efficient Package Installation**

```yaml
# tasks/main.yml - Efficient yum task
- name: Ensure web stack packages are installed
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: # List all packages needed in one go
      - httpd
      - mod_ssl
      - php
      - php-mysqlnd
      - mariadb-server
    state: present
  become: true
  tags: [packages, web, db] # Still taggable
```

**4. Enabling Profiling Callbacks**

```ini
# ansible.cfg - Enabling callbacks
[defaults]
inventory = inventory.yml
remote_user = devops
# Add other callbacks as needed, separated by commas
callbacks_enabled = ansible.posix.timer, ansible.posix.profile_tasks

[ssh_connection]
# Optionally enable pipelining if sudoers allows it
# pipelining = True
```

---

**Reminder:** Optimization often involves trade-offs (e.g., pipelining needs specific sudo config). Profiling helps you focus your optimization efforts on the tasks that actually take significant time. Tags are invaluable for managing large, multi-purpose playbooks. Practice these techniques to build faster and more flexible automation.
