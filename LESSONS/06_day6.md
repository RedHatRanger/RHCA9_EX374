## Day 6 Study Focus: Managing Inventory Variables

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* Structure inventory variables using `group_vars/` and `host_vars/` directories for better organization and maintainability. (**Relates to:** Create and manage inventory files using multiple files per host or group; Set up directories containing multiple host variable files).
* Understand basic variable precedence between inventory files, `group_vars/all`, `group_vars/<group>`, and `host_vars/<host>`.
* **Configure the remote host, port, or remote user** for a specific managed host using special inventory variables.
* **Override names used in inventory files with a different name or IP address** using `ansible_host`.

### Conceptual Overview: Organizing Variables with `group_vars` and `host_vars`

Yesterday, we saw how to put variables directly inside the YAML inventory file using `vars:`. While okay for very simple things, it quickly becomes messy. A much better, more organized, and recommended way is to use special directories:

1.  **`group_vars/`:** This directory sits next to your inventory file (or your playbook file if the inventory is in the same directory). Inside `group_vars/`, you create files or subdirectories named *exactly* like your inventory groups.
    * **`group_vars/all/` (or `group_vars/all.yml`):** Variables here apply to *every single host* in your inventory. Good for global settings like an NTP server.
    * **`group_vars/<group_name>.yml`:** A file containing variables for all hosts in the group `<group_name>`.
    * **`group_vars/<group_name>/` (Directory):** You can also create a directory named after the group. Ansible will read *all* `.yml` (or `.yaml`, `.json`) files inside this directory and apply their variables to the group. This is great for organizing variables by function (e.g., `group_vars/web_servers/apache.yml`, `group_vars/web_servers/firewall.yml`).

2.  **`host_vars/`:** This directory also sits next to your inventory or playbook. Inside `host_vars/`, you create files or subdirectories named *exactly* like your inventory hostnames.
    * **`host_vars/<hostname>.yml`:** Variables in this file apply *only* to the host named `<hostname>`.
    * **`host_vars/<hostname>/` (Directory):** Similar to groups, you can have a directory for a host containing multiple variable files.

**Why use this structure?**

* **Organization:** Keeps variables separate from the host list. Easy to find settings for a specific group or host.
* **Readability:** Inventory file stays clean, just listing hosts and groups. Variable files are focused.
* **Maintainability:** Easier to update settings for a group without hunting through a large inventory file.
* **Reusability:** Group variable files can be easily reused across different inventories or projects if structured well.

**Variable Precedence (Simplified):**

Ansible needs to know which variable value to use if it's defined in multiple places. The basic rule is: **more specific overrides less specific.**

* `host_vars` (most specific) override...
* `group_vars` for specific groups, which override...
* `group_vars/all` (least specific inventory variables).

(Playbook variables defined within `vars:`, `vars_files:`, `include_vars:`, `set_fact:`, and role variables have their own precedence rules, generally overriding inventory variables).

### Conceptual Overview: Special Connection Variables

Sometimes, the name you use for a host in your inventory isn't the actual DNS name or IP address Ansible should connect to, or you need to connect using a non-standard port or user. Ansible provides special variables (often defined in `host_vars` or `group_vars`) to control this connection behavior:

* **`ansible_host`:** The actual hostname or IP address Ansible should connect to via SSH (or other connection method). This lets you use friendly, logical names in your inventory. **This is how you override the inventory name.**
    * *Example:* Inventory has `prod-web-01`, but `host_vars/prod-web-01.yml` has `ansible_host: 10.1.2.3`. Ansible will connect to `10.1.2.3` when managing `prod-web-01`.
* **`ansible_port`:** The SSH (or other connection) port number to use. Defaults to 22 for SSH.
* **`ansible_user`:** The username Ansible should use to log in to the remote host. Defaults to the user running `ansible-navigator`.
* **`ansible_ssh_private_key_file`:** Path to the specific SSH private key file to use for this connection.
* **`ansible_connection`:** The connection type to use (e.g., `ssh`, `winrm`, `local`, `docker`). `local` is special for running tasks directly on the control node/EE without SSH.
* **`ansible_become`:** Set to `true` or `yes` to enable privilege escalation (like `sudo`) for this host/group.
* **`ansible_become_user`:** The user to become (e.g., `root`). Defaults to `root`.
* **`ansible_become_method`:** The escalation method (`sudo`, `su`, etc.). Defaults to `sudo`.
* **`ansible_python_interpreter`:** Path to the Python interpreter on the remote host for Ansible modules to use. Usually auto-detected, but sometimes needed for specific setups (like multiple Python versions).

**Today's Goal:** Learn the `group_vars` and `host_vars` directory structure. Understand how to define variables there and the basic precedence. Practice using `ansible_host` to map logical names to connection targets and understand the purpose of other key connection variables.

### Examples

**1. Directory Structure Example**

```
my_ansible_project/
├── ansible.cfg
├── inventory.yml
├── site.yml
├── group_vars/
│   ├── all/              # Vars for ALL hosts
│   │   └── common_settings.yml
│   ├── web_servers/      # Vars for 'web_servers' group
│   │   ├── apache.yml
│   │   └── firewall.yml
│   └── db_servers.yml    # Vars for 'db_servers' group (single file method)
└── host_vars/
    ├── web1.example.com.yml # Vars specific to web1
    └── [db1.example.com/](https://db1.example.com/)     # Vars specific to db1 (directory method)
        ├── mysql_tuning.yml
        └── backups.yml
```

**2. Example Variable Files**

* **`group_vars/web_servers/apache.yml`:**
    ```yaml
    ---
    apache_listen_port: 8080
    apache_doc_root: /var/www/main_site
    ```
* **`host_vars/web1.example.com.yml`:**
    ```yaml
    ---
    # Override group setting just for this host
    apache_listen_port: 80
    # Host-specific setting
    server_admin_email: web1_admin@example.com
    ```

**3. Using `ansible_host` for Logical Names**

* **`inventory.yml`:**
    ```yaml
    # Using logical names in the inventory
    production:
      children:
        web:
          hosts:
            web_prod_1: # Logical name
            web_prod_2:
        db:
          hosts:
            db_prod_master: # Logical name
    ```
* **`host_vars/web_prod_1/connection.yml`:** (Using directory method for host vars)
    ```yaml
    ---
    # Tell Ansible how to connect to the host named 'web_prod_1' in the inventory
    ansible_host: 10.10.1.50 # The actual IP address
    ansible_user: deploy_user # Connect as this user
    ```
* **`host_vars/db_prod_master/connection.yml`:**
    ```yaml
    ---
    ansible_host: db-master.prod.internal # Connect via internal DNS name
    ansible_port: 22 # Explicitly state port (though default)
    ansible_become: true # Needs sudo
    ```

**Reminder:** Organizing variables well is key to maintainable automation. `group_vars` and `host_vars` are the standard way. Using `ansible_host` makes your inventory much more readable when dealing with IPs or complex hostnames. Practice creating these files and directories.
