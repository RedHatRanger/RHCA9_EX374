## Day 3 Study Focus: Ansible Content Collections Basics

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* Understand the structure and purpose of **Ansible Content Collections**.
* **Use content collections in playbooks** by referencing modules and roles with Fully Qualified Collection Names (FQCN).
* Find documentation for modules within collections using `ansible-navigator doc`.

---

### Conceptual Overview: Ansible Content Collections

Think back to the toolbox analogy from Day 1. Ansible Content Collections are the specialized toolkits you use with the main Ansible engine. Instead of one giant toolbox with every possible tool, you get a basic set (`ansible.builtin`) and add specific toolkits (Collections) as needed.

**What's in a Collection?**

* **Modules:** The main tools that perform actions (e.g., install a package, start a service, create a file).
* **Roles:** Pre-packaged sets of tasks, variables, handlers, and templates that perform a larger function (e.g., a role to completely set up a web server).
* **Plugins:** Other types of extensions like lookup plugins (get external data), filter plugins (transform data), callback plugins (change Ansible's output), etc.

**Why Collections?**

* **Organization:** Groups related content together (e.g., all AWS tools in `amazon.aws`).
* **Versioning:** Collections can be versioned independently from Ansible Core. You can choose to use version 1.2 of a collection even if Ansible Core is newer, or vice-versa (within compatibility limits).
* **Distribution:** Makes it easier for vendors (like Cisco, AWS, Red Hat) and the community to create, share, and maintain their specific Ansible content via Automation Hub or Ansible Galaxy.
* **Modularity:** You only need to install the collections you actually use, keeping your environment cleaner.

**Using Content from Collections: The FQCN**

This is crucial! To use a module, role, or plugin from a collection, you **must** use its **Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN)**.

* **Format:** `namespace.collection_name.content_name`
    * `namespace`: The creator (e.g., `ansible`, `community`, `redhat`, `cisco`).
    * `collection_name`: The specific toolkit (e.g., `builtin`, `posix`, `mysql`, `ios`).
    * `content_name`: The specific module, role, or plugin (e.g., `yum`, `firewalld`, `user`, `template`).

* **Examples:**
    * `ansible.builtin.yum`: The `yum` module from the built-in collection.
    * `ansible.posix.firewalld`: The `firewalld` module from the `posix` collection developed by the `ansible` namespace maintainers.
    * `community.mysql.mysql_db`: The `mysql_db` module from the `mysql` collection developed by the `community` namespace maintainers.

* **Why FQCN?** It prevents naming collisions. Two different collections might have a module named `configure_thing`. Using the FQCN ensures Ansible knows exactly which one you mean. *Always use the FQCN in your playbooks.*

**Finding Documentation for Collection Content**

Since modules are now in collections, you need to know how to find help for them.

* **Command:** `ansible-navigator doc <FQCN>`
* **Example:** `ansible-navigator doc ansible.posix.firewalld` will show the documentation and examples for the `firewalld` module within the currently active Execution Environment.
* **Listing:** `ansible-navigator doc -l -t module` (or `-t lookup`, `-t filter`, etc.) lists all content of that type available in the EE.

**Collections and Execution Environments (EEs)**

Remember EEs from Day 1? Standard EEs (like `ee-supported-rhel8`) come pre-packaged with common collections (`ansible.builtin`, `ansible.posix`, etc.). If your playbook only needs modules from collections already *inside* the EE you are using, you don't need to install anything extra. If you need a collection *not* included in your EE, you'll need to install it (covered more tomorrow).

**Today's Goal:** Understand that automation content is packaged in Collections. Practice identifying and using the FQCN for modules in your playbooks. Learn how to look up documentation for specific modules within collections.

### Examples

**1. Playbook Using FQCNs**

This example explicitly uses FQCNs for clarity and best practice.

```yaml
# configure_server.yml - Using FQCNs
---
- name: Configure Basic Web Server
  hosts: web_servers
  become: true # Need root privileges
  tasks:
    - name: Install base packages
      # FQCN for the built-in yum module
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name:
          - httpd
          - firewalld
        state: present

    - name: Ensure httpd service is running and enabled
      # FQCN for the built-in service module
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true

    - name: Allow HTTP traffic in firewall
      # FQCN for the firewalld module in the ansible.posix collection
      ansible.posix.firewalld:
        service: http       # Allow the standard HTTP service
        permanent: true     # Make the rule persistent across reboots
        state: enabled      # Ensure the rule is active
        immediate: true     # Apply the rule right away (no need for separate reload)
```

**2. Finding Module Documentation (Illustrative Command)**

```bash
# Find help for the 'firewalld' module within the 'ansible.posix' collection
# Assumes you are using an EE that contains ansible.posix

ansible-navigator doc ansible.posix.firewalld

# List all modules available in the current EE
ansible-navigator doc -l -t module -m stdout
```

**Reminder:** Focus on understanding the *concept* of collections and the *syntax* of FQCNs today. The detailed explanations and hands-on practice in the course materials are essential for mastering this.
