### Conceptual Overview: Using Git for Ansible Projects

Think of Git as a powerful "save" button and "undo" feature for your entire project folder, plus a way to collaborate with others without stepping on each other's toes. For Ansible, your "project" is usually the collection of playbooks, roles, inventory files, and variable files.

**Why use Git?**

* **History Tracking:** Git remembers every "save" (called a **commit**) you make. You can look back at old versions, see exactly what changed, and who changed it.
* **Experimentation (Branching):** You can create a separate copy of your project's timeline (called a **branch**) to try out new ideas or fix bugs. If it works, you can merge it back into the main timeline. If it doesn't, you can just discard the branch without affecting the main code. This is essential for testing changes safely.
* **Collaboration:** Git helps multiple people work on the same project. It has mechanisms to merge different people's changes together and highlight conflicts if two people changed the same line.
* **Backup:** Storing your project on a remote Git server (like GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket) acts as a backup.
* **Automation Controller Integration:** Automation Controller primarily works by pulling your playbooks directly from a Git repository.

**Basic Git Workflow:**

1.  **`git clone <repository_url>`:** Get a copy of an existing project from a remote server onto your computer.
2.  **`git checkout -b <new_branch_name>`:** Create a new branch (timeline) for your work and switch to it. *Always work on a branch, not directly on the main one.*
3.  **Make Changes:** Edit your playbooks, roles, inventory files, etc., using your text editor.
4.  **`git status`:** See which files you've changed or created.
5.  **`git add <file1> <file2> ...`:** Tell Git which specific changes you want to include in your next save point (commit). This is called "staging".
6.  **`git commit -m "Your descriptive message"`:** Create a snapshot (save point) of your staged changes in your *local* repository's history. The message should explain *why* you made the changes.
7.  **`git push -u origin <your_branch_name>`:** Send your committed changes from your local branch up to the remote server. The `-u origin <branch>` part links your local branch to the remote one the first time you push it. Subsequent pushes on the same branch usually just need `git push`.

**Ignoring Files (`.gitignore`):**

* Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project.
* List file names or patterns (like `*.log` or `my_secret_vars.yml` or directories like `.ssh/`) that Git should *not* track or save. This prevents accidentally committing temporary files, artifacts, or sensitive information.

**Today's Goal:** Get comfortable with the basic Git cycle: clone, branch, edit, add, commit, push. Understand why version control is essential for managing automation code.

### Conceptual Overview: Ansible Recommended Practices

While Ansible is flexible, following some recommended practices makes your automation much easier to read, understand, maintain, and troubleshoot, especially as projects grow or when working in teams.

**Key Ideas:**

1.  **Keep it Simple & Readable:**
    * **Names:** Give plays, tasks, and variables meaningful names (use `name:`). Don't use cryptic abbreviations.
    * **Comments:** Use `#` comments to explain *why* you're doing something, not just *what* (the `name:` should cover the *what*).
    * **Spacing:** Use consistent indentation (usually 2 spaces) and blank lines to visually separate logical blocks of tasks.
    * **Native YAML:** Use the standard multi-line YAML format for modules, not the single-line "folded" syntax. It's much easier to read.
        * *Good:*
            ```yaml
            ansible.builtin.yum:
              name: httpd
              state: present
            ```
        * *Less Readable:* `ansible.builtin.yum: name=httpd state=present`
    * **Use Modules:** Prefer using specific Ansible modules (`ansible.builtin.service`, `ansible.posix.firewalld`, etc.) over generic `ansible.builtin.command` or `ansible.builtin.shell`. Modules are generally idempotent (safe to run multiple times) and handle state checking better.
    * **Explicit State:** Always specify the `state` for modules (e.g., `state: present`, `state: started`, `state: enabled`) even if it's the default. Defaults can change between versions.

2.  **Stay Organized:**
    * **Project Structure:** Follow a standard directory layout (e.g., separate directories for `roles`, `group_vars`, `host_vars`, inventory files). This makes projects predictable.
    * **Roles:** Group related tasks, variables, templates, and handlers into reusable roles for specific functions (e.g., setting up a web server, configuring a database).
    * **Collections:** Package related roles, modules, and plugins into collections for sharing and reuse (covered more later).
    * **Variable Naming:** Use descriptive variable names. Prefix variables defined within a role with the role name (e.g., `apache_port` instead of just `port`) to avoid naming conflicts between roles.
    * **Variable Location:** Define variables in appropriate places (e.g., `group_vars/` for settings common to a group, `host_vars/` for host-specific overrides, role `defaults/` for easily overridable role settings, role `vars/` for role-internal variables). Avoid scattering variables everywhere.

3.  **Test Often:**
    * **Syntax Check:** Run `ansible-playbook --syntax-check <playbook.yml>` (or use `ansible-navigator run --mode stdout ... --syntax-check`) frequently to catch basic YAML errors.
    * **Linting:** Use tools like `ansible-lint` (often integrated into editors or CI/CD) to check for potential problems and style issues.
    * **Idempotence:** Design tasks so they can be run multiple times without causing unintended side effects. Test by running your playbooks more than once.
    * **Check Mode:** Run playbooks with `--check` (check mode) to see what *would* change without actually making changes.
    * **Small Steps:** Develop and test in small, incremental steps.

**Today's Goal:** Start thinking about how to write clear, organized, and reliable Ansible code. Focus on naming, comments, using modules correctly, and basic syntax checking.

### Examples

**1. Git Workflow Commands (Illustrative)**

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone [https://git.example.com/student/review-cr1.git](https://git.example.com/student/review-cr1.git) my-ansible-project
cd my-ansible-project

# Create a branch for your work
git checkout -b feature/add-webserver-config

# Edit a playbook file
# vim roles/apache/tasks/main.yml
# (Make changes...)

# Edit a variables file
# vim group_vars/webservers.yml
# (Make changes...)

# Check what you changed
git status

# Stage the specific files you want to commit
git add roles/apache/tasks/main.yml group_vars/webservers.yml

# Commit the staged changes with a clear message
git commit -m "Configure Apache vhost and update webserver variables"

# Push your new branch and commits to the remote server
git push -u origin feature/add-webserver-config
```

**2. Playbook Readability Example**

```yaml
# webserver_setup.yml - Example emphasizing readability
---
- name: Configure Web Server Base Settings # Clear play name
  hosts: web_servers
  become: true # Need root for most tasks here
  tasks:
    - name: Ensure essential web packages are installed # Clear task name
      # Using standard YAML block format
      ansible.builtin.yum:
        name:
          - httpd
          - mod_ssl # Package for HTTPS
        state: present # Explicitly state the desired outcome
      tags: # Tag for selective runs
        - packages
        - setup

    # Add a blank line for visual separation before the next logical step

    - name: Ensure httpd service is enabled and started
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd # The service name
        enabled: true # Ensure it starts on boot
        state: started # Ensure it is running now
      tags:
        - services
        - setup

    # Comment explaining the next task's purpose
    # Configure the main Apache configuration file using a template
    - name: Deploy Apache configuration from template
      ansible.builtin.template:
        src: templates/httpd.conf.j2 # Source template file
        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf # Destination on target host
        owner: root
        group: root
        mode: '0644' # Set file permissions
      notify: Restart Apache # Notify handler if template results in a change
      tags:
        - configuration

  handlers: # Handlers defined at the end of the play
    - name: Restart Apache # Clear handler name
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        state: restarted # Action the handler performs
```
