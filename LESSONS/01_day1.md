## Day 1 Study Focus: AAP 2 & Navigator Basics

**Objectives for Today (Aligned with EX374 Skills):**

* Understand the role of **Content Collections** and **Execution Environments** within Ansible Automation Platform 2.
* Understand how to use `ansible-navigator` to run playbooks within **Execution Environments**. (Foundation for *Manage task execution* and interacting with *Automation Controller* later).
* Execute a basic Ansible Playbook using `ansible-navigator` that utilizes modules from standard **Content Collections** (like `ansible.builtin` and `ansible.posix`) within a standard **Execution Environment**. (Practical application combining understanding of EEs, Collections, and playbook execution).

### Conceptual Overview: What is Ansible Automation Platform 2?

Imagine you have a lot of computers (servers) and you need to perform the same tasks on many of them, like installing software, updating files, or starting services. Doing this manually on each one is slow and prone to mistakes. Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) is like a super-advanced toolkit designed to automate these tasks reliably and consistently across many computers.

First, let's look at the main pieces of this toolkit (AAP 2 components):

1.  **Ansible Core:** This is the "brain" or the engine. It understands the instructions you write in special files called **Playbooks** (written in a format called YAML). It knows the basic rules of automation.
2.  **Ansible Content Collections:** Think of these as specialized toolboxes. Instead of Ansible Core having every single tool imaginable built-in (which would make it huge!), it uses Collections.
    * A Collection bundles related tools (called **modules**, **roles**, and **plugins**) for a specific purpose, like managing network devices (`cisco.ios`), interacting with a specific cloud (`amazon.aws`), or handling basic Linux tasks (`ansible.posix`).
    * The `ansible.builtin` collection is the most basic toolkit that always comes with Ansible Core.
    * You refer to tools inside collections using their full name: `namespace.collection_name.module_name` (e.g., `ansible.posix.firewalld`). This is called the **Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN)**.
3.  **Execution Environments (EEs):** These are like portable, self-contained workshops. An EE is a container image that bundles:
    * A specific version of Ansible Core.
    * The specific Collections (toolkits) needed for your automation.
    * Any other necessary software (like Python libraries or system tools) that those collections require.
    * **Why are they important?** They guarantee that your automation runs exactly the same way whether you run it on your laptop or in the big control center (Automation Controller), because the "workshop" is identical. This solves many problems where automation worked "on my machine" but failed elsewhere.
4.  **Automation Content Navigator (`ansible-navigator`):** This is the modern command-line tool you use to run your Playbooks.
    * It runs your Playbook *inside* an Execution Environment.
    * It has an interactive mode (Text-based User Interface or TUI) for exploring results, and a standard output mode (`-m stdout`) that mimics older commands.
    * It replaces older tools like `ansible-playbook`.
5.  **Automation Controller:** This is the central web-based dashboard and control center for managing automation across an organization. You can:
    * Store credentials securely.
    * Manage inventories (lists of computers).
    * Define job templates (how to run a specific playbook).
    * Schedule automation jobs.
    * Control who can run what (Role-Based Access Control - RBAC).
    * View logs and results.
6.  **Automation Hub:** This is like an app store or library for Ansible Content Collections.
    * **Red Hat Automation Hub (console.redhat.com):** Contains certified, supported Collections from Red Hat and partners.
    * **Private Automation Hub:** An organization can host its own Hub to share its custom-built Collections or curated sets of certified/community collections.
    * **Ansible Galaxy:** The public community site for sharing collections (quality varies).

**Today's Goal:** Understand that AAP 2 uses EEs for consistency, `ansible-navigator` is the command to run things inside EEs, and Collections package the automation tools (modules/roles).

### Conceptual Overview: Running a Playbook with `ansible-navigator`

Next, let's look at using `ansible-navigator`:

* **Basic Command:** `ansible-navigator run <your_playbook.yml>`
* **Execution Environment:** By default, Navigator tries to use a standard EE (like `ee-supported-rhel8`). If it's not found locally, it will try to download (pull) it from a container registry.
* **Pulling EEs:** To download EEs from registries like `registry.redhat.com` or a private hub, you usually need to log in first using `podman login <registry_address>`. The `--pull-policy` (`--pp`) option tells Navigator *when* to pull (e.g., `missing` - only if not local, `always`, `never`).
* **Specifying an EE:** Use `--execution-environment-image` (`--eei`) to tell Navigator *which* EE image to use (e.g., `--eei registry.redhat.io/ansible-automation-platform-22/ee-supported-rhel8:latest`).
* **Output Modes:**
    * Default is interactive (TUI): Good for exploring results after a run.
    * `-m stdout`: Prints output directly to the terminal like the older `ansible-playbook` command. Useful for scripting or quick checks.
* **Authentication:** Navigator needs to connect to the computers you want to manage (usually via SSH). It can automatically use SSH keys loaded into `ssh-agent` on your control machine and pass them into the EE.

**Today's Goal:** Practice the basic `ansible-navigator run` command, understand the need for EEs, and see how to specify one if needed. Try both interactive and `stdout` modes.

### Example (Simple Playbook Run)

This illustrates a basic playbook structure and how you might run it using modules from standard collections.

```yaml
# intranet.yml - A simple playbook example
---
- name: Enable intranet services # Play description
  hosts: servera.lab.example.com # Target host
  become: true                  # Use sudo
  tasks:
    - name: latest version of httpd and firewalld installed
      # Using a module from the ansible.builtin collection
      ansible.builtin.yum: # Module to manage packages
        name: [httpd, firewalld] # List of packages
        state: latest      # Ensure these packages are present and latest

    - name: test html page is installed
      # Using another module from ansible.builtin
      ansible.builtin.copy:
        content: "Welcome to the example.com intranet!\n" # Simple content
        dest: /var/www/html/index.html # Where to put the file

    - name: firewalld permits http service
      # Using a module from the ansible.posix collection (often included in standard EEs)
      ansible.posix.firewalld:
        service: http
        permanent: true
        state: enabled
        immediate: true # Apply the rule now

    - name: httpd enabled and running
      # Using ansible.builtin again
      ansible.builtin.service:
        name: httpd
        enabled: true
        state: started

- name: Test intranet web server # Another play
  hosts: localhost             # Runs on the control node/EE
  become: false
  tasks:
    - name: connect to intranet web server
      ansible.builtin.uri: # Module to interact with URLs
        url: [http://servera.lab.example.com](http://servera.lab.example.com)
        status_code: 200     # Check if the server responds with OK
```

* **Running it (Illustrative):**
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are logged into the registry if the EE isn't local
    # podman login hub.lab.example.com (or registry.redhat.com)

    # Run using the default supported EE, show output directly
    # This EE typically includes ansible.builtin and ansible.posix
    ansible-navigator run intranet.yml -m stdout --eei ee-supported-rhel8
    ```

**Reminder:** This overview simplifies things. For a full understanding and to prepare for the exam, focusing on the concepts and practicing with hands-on exercises is crucial. They contain critical details and practical steps.
